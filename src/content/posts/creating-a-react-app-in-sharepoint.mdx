In SharePoint we can create custom pages and those pages can be customized using small buildings blocks called 'web parts'. Web parts add dynamic data to a SharePoint page. We can create React web parts using the [SPFx Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview). When we edit just a few flags, we can create a full page React application, allowing for even more customizations on a SharePoint page, while we still have easy access to SharePoint data, like the currently logged-in user and SharePoint lists. In this post I describe in summary what you may need to create a React app that runs in Sharepoint. We just need the following to get started:

- a SharePoint tenant
- a Communication Site and custom page created in this tenant
- a Full Width Column added to that page
- a SPFx-application project repository

## Creating the app

Follow [Microsoft's guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/build-a-hello-world-web-part#create-a-new-web-part-project) to
generate a new web part project. In order to enable full width support, add the following flag to the `{webpart_name}.manifest.json` configuration file:

```javascript
...
"supportsFullBleed": true,
...
```

By setting this flag, we are able to add the web part to a Full Width Column and it will become mobile responsive as well. We created the React app using the SPFx framework, because we need a .sppkg file to deploy the web part to a SharePoint tenant's site collection app catalog. And this way we are being provided with additional SharePoint API's.

### Starting the development environment

Run `npm run serve` in the root directory.
Go to `https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/sites/{site}/SitePages/{page}.aspx?debug=true&noredir=true&debugManifestsFile=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A4321%2Ftemp%2Fmanifests.js` in the browser, and click "Load debug scripts" to start the development environment. In this environment you can add the web part to a Full Width Column on the page. This is only the locally running web part and it won't be visible to the end user yet.

### Slow build times?!

[spfx-fast-serve](https://github.com/s-KaiNet/spfx-fast-serve) to the rescue. No idea why this isn't built-in yet.

## Styling

[Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui) by Microsoft contains React components, which we can use to blend our web part with other elements on SharePoint. To blend even more, [theme colors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/use-theme-colors-in-your-customizations#use-theme-colors-in-the-sharepoint-framework) are available. Using CSS Modules we can do something like the following to reference Sharepoint's global theme.

```css
.className {
  color: '[theme: themeDarkAlt]';
}
```

## Routing

In a standard web part you wouldn't need routing, because web parts are generally used like small building blocks, created to show additional information on a SharePoint page, and not as full page applications. However, we can include routing using the [HashRouter](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/HashRouter).
As the deployment url is something like `tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/MySite`, HashRouter simply routes based on the url's hash, making the routes something like this: `tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/MySite#/your/route/here`.

## Data

There are [several API's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/connect-to-sharepoint) available to use. We might choose the Microsoft Graph API.
Start fetching data by creating a Graph API client in your `BaseClientSideWebPart` class:

```javascript
this.context.msGraphClientFactory.getClient().then((client: MSGraphClient) => {
  //
})
```

## Deployment

Run the following commands to create a SharePoint add-ins package file (.sppkg file):

```javascript
gulp bundle --ship
gulp package-solution --ship
```

We need this .sppkg file (found in the `sharepoint` directory) to deploy the app to a SharePoint tenant's site collection app catalog, so we can add the hosted web part to a Full Width Column on the SharePoint page. After publishing the page, the web part will be visible to the end user, as we reference a web part hosted on SharePoint.

Cheers!
