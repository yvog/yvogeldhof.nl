SharePoint web parts are small applications added to a communication and/or team site within a SharePoint tenant.
Communication sites are in contrast to team sites responsive. They contain a full width column which allows us to create responsive React applications as a web part.
This post covers useful techniques to create an app that adds new functionality to your SharePoint site. Please note, this is not an in-depth guide.

## Creating the app

Follow [Microsoft's guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/build-a-hello-world-web-part#create-a-new-web-part-project) to
generate a new web part project. To enable full width support, add the following flag to the `{name}.manifest.json` config file:

```javascript
...
"supportsFullBleed": true,
...
```

### Starting the development environment

Run `npm run serve` in the root directory.
Go to `https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/sites/{site}/SitePages/{page}.aspx?debug=true&noredir=true&debugManifestsFile=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A4321%2Ftemp%2Fmanifests.js` in the browser, and click "Load debug scripts" to start the development environment. Don't forget to actually add your web part to a full width column on the site ;)

### Slow build times?!

[spfx-fast-serve](https://github.com/s-KaiNet/spfx-fast-serve) to the rescue. No idea why this isn't built-in.

## Styling

[Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui) by Microsoft contains React components which come in handy for us to blend our web part with the site.
To blend even more, [theme colors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/use-theme-colors-in-your-customizations#use-theme-colors-in-the-sharepoint-framework) are available. Using CSS Modules you can do the following to reference the Sharepoint's global theme.

```css
.className {
  color: '[theme: themeDarkAlt]';
}
```

## Routing

Normally you wouldn't need routing, because web parts are generally used to display additional information on the SharePoint site.
However, we can create a React application as a web part, including routing, using the [HashRouter](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/HashRouter).
As the deployment url is something like `tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/MySite`, HashRouter simply routes based on the url hash, making the routes like this: `tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/MySite#/my/route/here`.

## Data

There are [several API's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/connect-to-sharepoint) available to use. We might choose the Microsoft Graph API.
Start fetching data by creating a Graph API client in your `BaseClientSideWebPart` class:

```javascript
this.context.msGraphClientFactory.getClient().then((client: MSGraphClient) => {
  //
})
```

## Deployment

Run the following commands to create a SharePoint add-ins package file. Upload the resulting .sppkg file (found in the `sharepoint` directory) to your site collection app catalog. Add it to a column on your site, and publish the page.

```javascript
gulp bundle --ship
gulp package-solution --ship
```

Cheers!
