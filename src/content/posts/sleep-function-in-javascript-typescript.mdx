It's summer time, temperatures outside are rising. Possibly your body is feeling sleepy because of this, and so areâ€¦ JavaScript and TypeScript. The following code snippet allows you to delay your code by x milliseconds, in a way you are used to in languages like C++, C#, Java...

```javascript
export const sleep = async (milliseconds: number): Promise<void> => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve();
    }, milliseconds);
  });
};
```

Usage:
```javascript
onClick={async (event) => {
	await sleep(100);
	
	// do some innovative stuff here
}
```

Hope it helps!
