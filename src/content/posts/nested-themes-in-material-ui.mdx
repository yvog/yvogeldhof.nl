Material UI (MUI) is a great framework with many built-in features, including accessability, components, styling with (optionally) Emotion and theming.
I really enjoy working with it in current projects in combination with TypeScript. Customizability is also great. For example, in the theme we can override MUI component styles and
even add new properties by extending the typings. In this post I will further focus on the theme feature. Let's explore a technique called nested themes.

## Why we need nested themes

Normally, a website design could consist of 2 themes: a light theme and a dark theme. Typically this results in a page being rendered using a single theme.
But what if the content editor can choose between 3 different background colours for every component on the page? Automatically the contrast text changes as well and probably other theme properties too.

### What makes it nested?

- The base theme is the primary theme and derivative themes will only change properties relevant for them.
- When taken a step further, we can also split up the themes in components, where the upperhalf is rendered using the primary theme and only the bottom half is rendered using the secondary theme, to create depth like this:

### Challenges

There are shared properties between themes. They probably all use the same typography, component overrides, and custom properties. We also need to pick the correct theme to render the component with.

## Creating the primary theme

The primary theme is the base theme and every other theme inherits it. It can be created using the following code:

```typescript
export const primaryTheme = withComponentOverrides(
  withTypography(
    createTheme({
      type: 'primary',
      palette: {
        primary: {
          main: '#FFF',
          light: '#FFF',
          contrastText: '#000',
        },
        secondary: {
          main: '#ABCDEF',
          contrastText: '#000',
        },
        tertiary: {
          main: '#123456',
          contrastText: '#FFF',
        },
        divider: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.20)`,
      },
      spacing: 8,
    } as ThemeOptions)
  )
)
```

## Adding component overrides

Component overrides can be added to a theme by either using chained functions or by nested function calls.
In this case we are using nested function calls.

```typescript
export const withComponentOverrides = (theme: Theme): Theme => {
  return createTheme({
    ...theme,
    components: {
      MuiCssBaseline: {
        styleOverrides: {
          html: {
            fontSize: '62.5%',
          },
        },
      },
      MuiCheckbox: {
        defaultProps: {
          checkedIcon: <Checkmark />,
        },
      },
    },
  } as ThemeOptions)
}
```

## Adding typography

Typography properties can be added as well using this way:

```typescript
export const withTypography = (theme: Theme): Theme => {
  const fontFamily = 'Arial'

  theme.typography.fontFamily = fontFamily

  theme.typography.h1 = {
    fontFamily,
    fontSize: '4rem',
    fontWeight: 700,
    lineHeight: 1.1,
    [theme.breakpoints.up('md')]: {
      fontSize: '6.4rem',
    },
  }

  theme.typography.overline = {
    fontFamily,
    fontSize: '2.0rem',
    fontWeight: 600,
    lineHeight: 2.5,
    textTransform: 'none',
    [theme.breakpoints.up('md')]: {
      fontSize: '2.4rem',
      lineHeight: 3.2,
    },
  }

  return theme
}
```

## Creating a secondary theme

Now let's create the secondary theme:

```typescript
export const secondaryThemeSettings = {
  type: 'secondary',
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#706',
      light: '#FFF',
      contrastText: '#FFF',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#FFF',
      contrastText: '#212121',
    },
    divider: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)`,
  },
} as ThemeOptions

export const secondaryTheme = withComponentOverrides(
  withTypography(createTheme(deepmerge(primaryTheme, secondaryThemeSettings)))
)
```

> 'deepmerge' is an utility function (imported from @mui/utils) which makes sure all properties are merged from the primary theme with the secondary theme.

## Adding custom properties to a MUI theme

We can add custom properties to a theme by creating a new `types.d.ts` file in the project and then extend types given by Material UI:

```typescript
import { Theme, ThemeOptions, Palette, PaletteOptions } from '@mui/material'

type ThemeVariants = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary' | 'quaternary'
type PaletteOption = Pick<Palette['primary'], 'main' | 'contrastText'>

declare module '@mui/material/styles' {
  interface Theme {
    type: ThemeVariants
  }

  interface ThemeOptions {
    type?: ThemeVariants
  }

  interface Palette {
    tertiary: PaletteOption
  }

  interface PaletteOptions {
    tertiary?: PaletteOption
  }
}
```

## Resolving a theme

Now the only missing piece is a `ThemeResolver` component which resolves and thereby set the correct theme for their children.
The code beneath could be used in a `Section` component or any other abstract container component.

```typescript
type ThemeResolverProps = {
  activeTheme: BackgroundType
}

export const ThemeResolver: React.FunctionComponent<ThemeResolverProps> = ({
  children,
  activeTheme,
}) => {
  let theme = primaryTheme

  switch (activeTheme) {
    case 'secondary':
      theme = secondaryTheme
      break
    case 'primary':
      theme = primaryTheme
      break
    default:
      break
  }

  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>
}
```
